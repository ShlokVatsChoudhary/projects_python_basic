# 🍿 Python Concession Cart — My First Python Project

Welcome to my very first Python project! 🚀  
This is a simple **concession cart** program that simulates a mini snack ordering experience from the terminal. It helped me practice core Python concepts like:

- Dictionaries
- Loops
- Conditional logic
- User input handling
- String formatting
- Basic time delays for a better user experience

## 🧾 Features

✅ A menu of 5 snacks and drinks  
✅ Ask users what they want to order  
✅ Take quantity as input  
✅ Calculate item-wise and total bill  
✅ Nicely printed final bill with delay animations

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. The program shows each item one by one and asks:  
   ➤ *"Do you want pop corn? (yes/no)"*

2. If **yes**, it asks:  
   ➤ *"How many do you want?"*

3. It stores all selected items and quantities in a cart.

4. After all items are processed, it prints a neat bill with itemized costs and total amount using formatted strings.

## 🖥️ How to Run

1. Save the code in a file named `concession_cart.py`.

2. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder where the file is saved.

3. Run the program using:

-> python concession_cart.py

If that doesn't work, try:

-> python3 concession_cart.py

## File Structure

- concession.py → Main source code
- README.md → Project info
